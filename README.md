This repo is for the Android coding interview for new developers :)

Candidates:
Please put build instructions, assumptions and any other notes that you'd like your reviewers to know about in this file

Sorry didn't write many tests, but wanted to showcase the clean architecture
which I know might be overkill, so it is more for demo purposes.

I was able to do one single(or 2) test(s) which I think is the most important:
UserPostItemBuilderTest

I started a sample of how to test things that include coroutine and flows, but didn't have time to clean and finish
GetUserPostListUseCaseTest

it tests that we get the emission.
just thought is a good showcase when dealing with flows and coroutines for testing.
